<p>Hello again! This project is one that I have been wanting to work on for a good while now, but due to time limitations, I have not been able to do so.</p>
<h2 id="project-idea">Project Idea:<a href="#project-idea" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I want to eventually get a Minecraft server on AWS, but to do so in the best way I can think of, I would like to have Docker and docker-compose set up to handle this so that I can quickly deploy my plan.</p>
<h2 id="investigation-stage">Investigation stage:<a href="#investigation-stage" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I knew that I wanted a Minecraft server that supported the aarch64 architecture as I was reasonably confident that I was going to be eventually hosting this on an A1 server at AWS and my test setup for this is a Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB model that I use for most of my home lab type stuff right now.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two main options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option one: Build the docker container myself and run from there.</li>
</ul>
<p>    - While this would in theory, be one of the best options as it allows for the highest level of control, it would also take the most time and effort.</p>
<ul>
<li>Option two: Use a preexisting Minecraft docker container.</li>
</ul>
<p>    - I investigated on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> and found a wonderful container called itzg/minecraft-server. It supports not only the aarch64 architecture I was interested in, but also has some of the best documentation that I have seen in a while.</p>
<h2 id="my-decision">My Decision:<a href="#my-decision" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>As was probably the smartest decision, I decided to go with the already created container from itzg. The main driving idea was that I didn&rsquo;t want to reinvent the wheel when someone had already made a better wheel than I could have.</p>
<h2 id="step-0-preapre">Step 0: Preapre<a href="#step-0-preapre" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I started by loading it into my already installed and configured Raspberry Pi 4. The O.S. I chose was aarch64 Ubuntu Server because I already had it installed and, since this project will be mostly run through Docker, the O.S. of choice made less of a difference than it could have.</p>
<p>If you are trying to follow along with me on this project, I would recommend using this site here for how to get to where I am now. <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview">How to install Ubuntu server</a></p>
<p>I skipped the part about installing a desktop environment as I wanted to save as much CPU power for the server as I could.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-install-docker">Step 1: Install Docker<a href="#step-1-install-docker" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>To install Docker for Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, I used the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install docker docker-compose</code></p>
<p>And from there, we will need to pull the Docker image. The command to do that is:</p>
<p><code>docker pull itzg/minecraft-server</code></p>
<p>(Note that the above command may have to be run as root depending on how Docker is configured)</p>
<h2 id="step-2-setup-my-docker-compose-yml-file">Step 2: Setup my docker compose yml file<a href="#step-2-setup-my-docker-compose-yml-file" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In a new directory (mine was in ~/server22/) I made a file called docker-compose.yml which looked like the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
version: &#34;3.3&#34;

services:

  mc:

    image: itzg/minecraft-server

    container_name: minecraft

    ports:

      - 25565:25565/tcp

    environment:

      EULA: &#34;TRUE&#34;

      MEMORY: 4G

      MOTD: &#34;Jett Trial Server Summer 22 Pi edition&#34;

      MAX_PLAYERS: 10

      SPAWN_PROTECTION: 0

      VIEW_DISTANCE: 8

      VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE: hlidX4

      ENABLE_RCON: false

    tty: true

    stdin_open: true

    restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:

      - ./:/data
</code></pre><p>The docker compose yml file above essentially starts the docker container with a specific set of settings enabled. Most of those settings will look similar to settings veteran minecraft server hosters would know about.</p>
<p>There are some commands of note though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>image - This is what Docker image to use. You may recognize it from earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ports  - This allows Docker to use port 25565 from your host machine. This is important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE - This is a specific set of vanilla tweaks that I want to use in my server. If you do not want any tweaks, do not use this line. If you want to customize your tweaks, go to <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/#">vanillatweaks</a> to generate your specific sharecode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ENABLE_RCON - This is a setting specific to the Docker container I am using. I did not want any RCON servers running in the background for security reasons because I am a bit paranoid. For that reason, I disabled it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>restart: unless-stopped - This means that unless I stop the server manually, it will restart itself. If the power gets cut to my Raspberry Pi, it should be able to restart itself on reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>volumes - I set the current working directory (in my example ~/server22) as the data folder for the minecraft server. This is really just an ease of use thing for me personally. Feel free to change this to whatever you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-3-profit">Step 3: Profit<a href="#step-3-profit" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>At this point, it should be as simple as running:</p>
<p><code>docker-compose up -d</code></p>
<p>In the directory you made your docker-compose.yml and then your server should be up.</p>
<p>Now there are some issues to resolve that are completely up to you. Those things are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Port forwarding so that you can access your server from outside your network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want a domain name so that you don&rsquo;t have to give your friends your IP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those two things can easily be found how to do online but are often specific to your own situation, so I will not be describing that process here. </p>
<p>That is all for now!</p>
<p>Jett</p>
