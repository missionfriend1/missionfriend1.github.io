        <h2 id="project-idea">Project Idea:<a href="#project-idea" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I would like to have a system for network virtualization service for my own persoal projects and homelab like setup.</p>
<h2 id="investigation-stage">Investigation stage<a href="#investigation-stage" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The initial idea for this project was inspired by my shcool&rsquo;s Cyber Range (which is currently maintained by yours truly). I really like how in the Cyber Range students can get a virtual machine hosted over the network to allow for a sandboxed environment that is ofloaded to a separate machine.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s Cyber Range runs on Openstack which is a really nice project, but it is a bit overly complicated for my needs in a personal project such as this. So I went to work and investigated the following systems to handle this for me while trying to find the best fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Openstack (<a href="https://www.openstack.org/">https://www.openstack.org/</a>)
<ul>
<li>This is a little bit too complex for my needs, but if I had more servers and time it would be fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ESXi by VMWare (<a href="https://core.vmware.com/esxi">https://core.vmware.com/esxi</a>)
<ul>
<li>This is far too expensive for me if I were to use the official version as it is enterprise and has enterprise level licenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proxmox
<ul>
<li>Open source and extremely simple setup in comparison to all others. It does require a very particular network setup especially over wifi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux with KVM and SPICE
<ul>
<li>Really nice and would be the most simple for me. Setting up new vms is a pain and manual networking of vms is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-decision">My Decision:<a href="#my-decision" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I have decided to go with Proxmox as at this point in time it makes the most sense for me to use it. Its free version is very appealing and it has a decently easy installer with easy to manage vms and vm networks.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-download-and-prepare">Step 1: Download and prepare<a href="#step-1-download-and-prepare" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I went to proxmox&rsquo;s website and specifically their download page (<a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve)">https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve)</a>.</p>
<p>From there I used the usb flasher tool rufus () to flash a spare usb drive with the iso.
For my specific setup, I needed the following settings in rufus to get it to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure it is in uefi mode not mbr or legacy or bios.</li>
<li>I had to flash it in DD mode when prompted because my laptop where I would be installing it did not like ISO mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation:<a href="#installation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Other than a few issues with the Dell bios, once I had booted into the Proxmox Installer, the installation was very straight forward.
In the future, I will come back to this part of my site and add pictures I took of the installation process and annotate them. I just need to figure out how to accomplish that with this website builder first and I wanted to get a little bit of this project out before I got carried away with other things.</p>
